# Homework 1: Semantic Tagging

## Objective 

In this assignment, I took pre-made HTML and CSS code and edited it according to the guidelines found in the README file. A reasonably detailed set of changes, according to the requirements, is listed below.

## Changes

I made sure the document's semantic tags fit a reasonable standard. This included changing a div elements to an img element to fit the rest of the document. There used to be a div that had a background image url, but this was not similarly done for the other imaged on the page, which is why I changed it. I also included a nav tag at the top to separate the navigation section appropriately.

There are several large groups of content on this webpage. I included comments that separate these large groups of texts being careful to only include information that is 'useful' (not already obvious) to the reader within the comments.

The img tag elements didn't have sufficient alt tags. I added them according to the context of the image within the page.

There was nothing linking the first header/navigation link until I added a new link. They are all also in order.

I added a useful tittle.

I added some meta tags to the body, which makes the page more search-engine friendly.

Unrelated to the assignment, I decided to add some image hover animations for practice.
